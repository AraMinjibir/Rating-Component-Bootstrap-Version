# Project Description

In my quest to enhance my skills in responsive design, I decided to transform all my previous exercises into responsive designs, and this project is one of them.

The project includes a container named 'container,' which houses a grid container (row). Within this row, there is a single column. The column contains a card with image and text.

The font-family used is 'Overpass,' with a font size of 15px and font weights of 700, 400.

Some CSS attributes provided were not documented in Bootstrap. However, I utilized custom CSS to tailor them, and I employed certain Bootstrap features to control their behavior. To adapt the knowledge I learnt about Code simplicity and re-userbility.

The expected outcome of the project can be found in the images folder.
